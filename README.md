# <sub>Update: no ye the support for StreamCameraOverHttp is dead until i get another notebook, i cant afford a camera and obs virtual camera works alot different than a real camera so its just, never gonna be right if i code it based on OBS.</sub>

# Extra: Since the start of this account ive been coding as close to AI code as i possibly could to see if someone would "AI"cusate me, which no one did! Humans really learned a LOT about knowing what is AI generated and what is actually made by Human. I was super happy when i came to this result, that means that now we are out of the "oh no is this AI or not?" era that was gpt-3 and gpt-4! Thanks!
